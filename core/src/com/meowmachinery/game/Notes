        Loading screen will display a background image,
        and will display text showing the loading percentage (assets).

        No interaction.

        Once finished, pass to MainMenuScreen.

    /*
        Options screen lets the user config the application stuff, and maybe some game stuff.

            - Fullscreen vs windowed
            - Screen resolution
            - Key binding? maybe a later iteration once units/players can do stuff

        Typical interaction stuff.
        Next screen: main menu
